**Background**

Communities rely heavily on a few primary water sources, most of which are located quite a distance from their homes. Many residents, particularly women and children, spend a significant portion of their day collecting water. This task often involves long walks under the sweltering sun, carrying heavy containers, and waiting in long lines at the water sources. The physical and time demands of this chore can be gruelling, especially for those who must balance it with work and household responsibilities.
Moreover, the reliance on these limited water sources leads to water collection points becoming crowded and sometimes even tense, as people compete for access to this precious resource. Such situations can potentially lead to disputes, and in some cases, escalate into criminal activities.
Our mission is to communicate with transparency: Where did the money go? We will track the total budget against project completion, monitor teams' performance, and compare budgeted versus actual costs to flag potential corruption, promoting transparency and accountability in addressing Maji Ndogoâ€™s water crisis.

**Key Questions Raised**
1. How many people did we survey in total?
2. How many wells, taps and rivers are there?
3. How many people share particular types of water sources on average?
4. How many people are getting water from each type of source?
5. How long did the survey take?
6. What is the average total queue time for water?
7. What is the average queue time on different days?
8. How can we communicate this information efficiently?
